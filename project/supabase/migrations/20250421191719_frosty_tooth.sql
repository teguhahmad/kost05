/*
  # Add multi-property support

  1. New Tables
    - `properties`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `name` (text)
      - `address` (text)
      - `city` (text)
      - `phone` (text)
      - `email` (text)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)
      - `owner_id` (uuid, foreign key to auth.users)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on properties table
    - Add policies for property access
